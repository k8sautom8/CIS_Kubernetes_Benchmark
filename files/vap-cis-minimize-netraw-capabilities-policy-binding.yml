# Validating Admission Policy
# Name: Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability
#       Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime.
#       By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities.
#       With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers.
#       Ideally, all containers should drop this capability.

### The namespace exclusion logic now moved into CRD, Parameter and embeded in Policy. This gives more flexibility on managing and maintaing common exclusions
### You can still exclude additional app namespaces which are specific to the policy exclusion using following matchExpressions
###
# matchResources:
#   namespaceSelector:
#     matchExpressions:
#     - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
#       operator: NotIn
#       values:
#       - app-one-namespace
#       - app-two-namespace
###
### OR using labels
###
# matchResources:
#   namespaceSelector:
#     matchExpressions:
#       namsSpaceSelector:
#         matchLabels:
#           environment: prod
