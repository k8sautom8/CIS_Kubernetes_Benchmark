# Validating Admission Policy
# Name: Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used
#       Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod.
#       Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account.
